    "We hypothesize that origin and material are the product attributes that will most influence the pricing of athleticwear. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is due to the nature of the clothing industry, which heavily relies on outsourcing work to foreign countries to reduce cost of production for goods, and a common occurance in many industries due to globalization, and comes down to companies being able to create their products with lower expenses elsewhere.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also believe material is a product attribute that will most influence pricing of athleticwear, as the actual cost of the material that is used to make the product is a logical factor in it's pricing, as not all materials are created equal.  For instance, materials like polyester cost less than something like merino wool, as polyester is a synthetic material derived from plastic and is easy and inexpensive to make, while merino wool is a natural material that is cost and labor intensive to create - meaning that the same item made of polyester versus merino wool would have drastically different costs to produce.  \n"

    "The ideal dataset we would want to answer this question would have variables such as brand of garment, garment subtype (ex. long-sleeve, shorts, etc), material garment is made of, color of garment, sale price of garment, production cost of garment, purchase frequency of garment (how many have been sold), customer rating of garment, country of production of garment, and gender the garment is marketed to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to have at least 100000 observations, with each general catergory within athleticware having approximiately 20000 observations, so that we have a more robust sample size for each type of garment we are analyzing. This would look like 20000 observations for tops, bottoms, footwear, undergarments, and outerwear.  Ideally, these garment types could be further organized by characteristics of the garment, such as long-sleeved tops, short-sleeved tops, sleeveless tops, when we further organize using the variables (specifically the garment subtype variable). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfect world, we would be able to obtain this data from the current top 5 athetic wear companies in the U.S. - Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Puma, and Lululemon, as these companies currently dominate the athleticwear market.  We would be taking this data from their inventory databases, which ideally have all the products they have created and released onto the market as observations, and our identified variables within their own dataset.  With all this data, we would take a random sample of size 4000 per category per brand, essentially stratifying the sample for each company we take data from, to make sure that we get the number of observations we need for each category. This step is necessary because if one category (type) of garment is the most popular or frequently created, then that could skew our results, since that type of garment would be overrepresented if we were to try to find the average of overall pricing.  Moreover, this would ensure that we have robust sample sizes if we wanted to do analyses by product category, since all categories would have 4000 observations, rather than some having many and some having less (which could yield a less accurate analysis, since the smaller sample is less likely to be representative of the entire population. \n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "> There are no human subjects involved in our data collection.\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> This study reflects pricing and marketing choices specific to only one brand because the data being analyzed comes only from Adidas. This limits an overall general analysis of the larger athleticwear market. To limit any bias, we will clearly mention that the results from this project describe pricing strategies specific to Adidas only and not the entire athleticwear industry.\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> There is no personal information that is being collected in our data collection.\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> We will check for unbalanced groups, especially with gender-specific items and the pricing associated with those products, as social bias since they might show Adidas’s marketing/pricing decisions.  \n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> No sensitive information is being stored. The datasets are from Kaggle and downloaded to a secure environment. \n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "> Not applicable to our project since the datasets were publicly shared by Kaggle.\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> The data will be archived and/or deleted after our team finishes analyzing and producing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> We will make sure that we clearly state that our analysis only includes Adidas data from Kaggle, not the broader athleticwear industry. \n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> We will make sure that we check for any imbalanced classes/representation in certain product features within our data before moving into the modeling process.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> We will clearly and honestly state our data cleaning, analysis and modeling process steps and make sure that our visualizations and reports accurately reflect our findings. \n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> No PII exist in our data, so there are no privacy risks or concerns regarding this.\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> All steps of analysis and modeling will be well documented in a Jupyter Notebook and in the GitHub repository to allow any replication in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> There aren't any specific demographic variables included in our data, however to make sure we mitigate proxy discrimination, we will interpret and check any gender-specific products to avoid reinforcing any stereotypes. \n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> We will check for any variations in pricing when it comes to gender-specific products to make sure that our results are neutral and not biased in any kind of way.\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We will use modeling techniques such as multiple linear regression to analyze the features in our data and loss functions such as MAE and/or MSE (Mean Absolute Error and/or Mean Squared Error) to optimize our defined metrics.\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> Coefficients and features that are involved in regression and other visualizations will be used to show how each variable influences the pricing of a product. \n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> Our findings will be communicated to be specific to Adidas's marketing and pricing strategy, not pricing for products in the broader athleticwear industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> Not applicable because our team is not planning to deploy this model.\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> Not applicable because individuals are not particulary affected by any outcomes of this model.\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> Not applicable because our model is not under production.\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> We will make sure to clarify that our model should not be used to justify variations in pricing within different product categories.\n"
