    "We hypothesize that origin and material are the product attributes that will most influence the pricing of athleticwear. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is due to the nature of the clothing industry, which heavily relies on outsourcing work to foreign countries to reduce cost of production for goods, and a common occurance in many industries due to globalization, and comes down to companies being able to create their products with lower expenses elsewhere.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also believe material is a product attribute that will most influence pricing of athleticwear, as the actual cost of the material that is used to make the product is a logical factor in it's pricing, as not all materials are created equal.  For instance, materials like polyester cost less than something like merino wool, as polyester is a synthetic material derived from plastic and is easy and inexpensive to make, while merino wool is a natural material that is cost and labor intensive to create - meaning that the same item made of polyester versus merino wool would have drastically different costs to produce.  \n"

    "The ideal dataset we would want to answer this question would have variables such as brand of garment, garment subtype (ex. long-sleeve, shorts, etc), material garment is made of, color of garment, sale price of garment, production cost of garment, purchase frequency of garment (how many have been sold), customer rating of garment, country of production of garment, and gender the garment is marketed to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to have at least 100000 observations, with each general catergory within athleticware having approximiately 20000 observations, so that we have a more robust sample size for each type of garment we are analyzing. This would look like 20000 observations for tops, bottoms, footwear, undergarments, and outerwear.  Ideally, these garment types could be further organized by characteristics of the garment, such as long-sleeved tops, short-sleeved tops, sleeveless tops, when we further organize using the variables (specifically the garment subtype variable). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a perfect world, we would be able to obtain this data from the current top 5 athetic wear companies in the U.S. - Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Puma, and Lululemon, as these companies currently dominate the athleticwear market.  We would be taking this data from their inventory databases, which ideally have all the products they have created and released onto the market as observations, and our identified variables within their own dataset.  With all this data, we would take a random sample of size 4000 per category per brand, essentially stratifying the sample for each company we take data from, to make sure that we get the number of observations we need for each category. This step is necessary because if one category (type) of garment is the most popular or frequently created, then that could skew our results, since that type of garment would be overrepresented if we were to try to find the average of overall pricing.  Moreover, this would ensure that we have robust sample sizes if we wanted to do analyses by product category, since all categories would have 4000 observations, rather than some having many and some having less (which could yield a less accurate analysis, since the smaller sample is less likely to be representative of the entire population. \n",
