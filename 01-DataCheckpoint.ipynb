    "## Background and Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The prevalence of athletic wear, whether worn for leisure or actual activity, has been on the rise. In fact, the athletic wear market now represents a substantial and rapidly growing segment of the global apparel industry, with the North American market alone valued at over 26 billion dollars in 2024, and a projected value of 677.26 billion dollars by 2030. Among other things, this rapid growth can be attributed to a culture that is increasingly health-conscious, and the not-unrelated merging of fashion and functionality, dubbed \"athleisure\". As casually-worn athletic wear becomes increasingly mainstream, however, there is the question of cost - specifically, what factors make it cost what it does?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the question of what drives apparel pricing has been examined before. Multiple countries have used the hedonic model to calculate the Consumer Price Index, used to track inflation, for apparel in their countries. The hedonic model uses regression to \"estimate a value for each characteristic of the item\", which then all sum to the total price of the item. The use of this technique allows researchers to make adjustments to account for seasonal changes and evolving product characteristics, essentially isolating the contribution of individual attributes to overall product pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One factor, material composition, represents one of the most fundamental drivers of garment pricing, with significant research demonstrating its importance. In the active wear market, synthetic materials were very popular, supported by widespread use of polyester, which has moisture-wicking properties and is durable, important qualities for active wear to have. However, consumer preferences are evolving with the times, and natural materials like organic cotton and bamboo blends are becoming more popular as eco-friendly and sustainable products, since sustainability has become a more mainstream concern. The price consumers are willing to pay for sustainable materials has been documented before. Research on outdoor apparel using hedonic pricing models found that material type had a statistically significant impact on item price, with different materials like cotton, polyester, wool, and nylon valued at different price points based on their breathability, durability, and environmental impact. Not to mention, raw material price fluctuations also significantly impact manufacturing costs for brands, with materials such as organic cotton subject to changes in supply and demand as well as energy and transportation costs. This cost pressure directly influences retail pricing strategies, as manufacturers must balance quality expectations with competitive pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important consideration for pricing that transcends the realm of clothing is the \"Pink Tax\", or gender-based pricing. This is a recorded phenomenon, even reported on by the U.S. Congress's Joint Economic Committee, which notes that \"... the frequency with which female consumers find themselves paying higher prices for gender-specific goods and services effectively becomes a tax on being a woman\". Gender-targeted marketing and its relationship to pricing represents one of the most controversial aspects of apparel pricing research, with another 2015 study by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs finding that women's clothing was 8% more expensive than men's clothing on average. Not only that, but women's clothing imports face higher average tariff rates than men's clothing, with women's clothing at 15.1% compared to 11.9% for men. However, other research challenges the notion of gender-based pricing. Studies like these find that most comparable products differed in their ingredient compositions, suggesting that price differences may reflect genuine product differentiation rather than discriminatory pricing. The debate centers on distinguishing between legitimate reasons in pricing difference and discriminatory practices, something we wish to also explore on a smaller level, in our analysis of what determines the cost of athletic wear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Country of Origin Effects**  \n",
    "Country of origin (COO) represents another well-established driver of consumer perceptions and pricing in apparel markets. The COO effect describes how consumers' attitudes, perceptions, and purchasing decisions are influenced by products' country of origin labeling, which may refer to where a brand is based, where products are designed, or where they are manufactured. Research has empirically demonstrated that the COO effect has significant price-related consequences, with brands possessing favorable COO associations able to charge price premiums over and above those attributed to observable product differentiation. The strength of COO effects varies considerably by product category and consumer characteristics. In apparel specifically, research examining clothing from multiple countries found that COO was related to assessment of product quality, but when evaluating purchase likelihood, COO seemed not to be as important, suggesting a more complex situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The influence of popularity metrics on pricing is a newer area of research enabled by e-commerce platforms, which we choose to measure in the form of customer reviews and ratings in the absence of actual total purchasing data. Consumer surveys consistently show that ratings and reviews are considered very important, with up to 98% of shoppers saying reviews are an \"essential resource when making purchase decisions\". Research also demonstrates that products with five reviews have 270% greater purchase likelihood than products with no reviews, but these benefits diminish rapidly after the first five reviews, according to Northwestern. Conjoint analysis research also indicates that \"consumers considered star rating, number of reviews, online shopping platform, and premium reviews to be more important than price when making an online shopping decision\". However, there are many factors that differentiate from study to study, and so we would like to uncover ourselves how perceived popularity influence product pricing in the realm of active wear.\n",
    "\n",
    "While individual attributes influencing apparel pricing have been studied on their own, comprehensive research examining the effects of material, color, category, origin, gender-targeting, and popularity metrics specifically within the athleticwear segment is still limited. As such, we plan to employ a comprehensive dataset of U.S. athleticwear products to try to quantify the relative importance of these diverse attributes in determining price, and hopefully providing insight into the factors that decide how much a product costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Athleticwear has become one of the biggest parts of the fashion industry, especially with the rise of fitness culture and athleisure clothing. Big brands like Adidas have built their image around performance and lifestyle wear, selling products that mix comfort, function, and style. Research on fashion pricing has shown that things like brand reputation, material quality, and product design have a big impact on how much items cost online. One study found that brands with stronger reputations tend to keep higher prices and are less likely to discount their items.

    "\n",
    "Another study on denim clothing showed that items made from unique or mixed materials often had higher prices because people see them as higher quality. [Source](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-7248/3/1/2?utm_source)\n",
    "\n",
    "For Adidas specifically, there’s been some research on its marketing and pricing strategies, but not much on what exact product attributes drive those prices. One paper mentioned that Adidas focuses heavily on innovation and sustainability while still trying to improve how it prices and markets its products. [Source](https://www.ewadirect.com/proceedings/aemps/article/view/3640?utm_source)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study found that brand image, product quality, and marketing are major factors influencing how customers view Adidas and what they’re willing to pay. [Source](https://bsq.cultechpub.com/index.php/bsq/article/view/2?utm_source)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though these studies show that branding and quality matter, they don’t really dig into which features like material, color, or product category make certain Adidas items cost more than others. Our project aims to explore that gap by analyzing online pricing data for Adidas products in the U.S. to see which product details have the biggest impact on price.\n",

This is due to the nature of the clothing industry, which heavily relies on outsourcing work to foreign countries to reduce cost of production for goods. We also believe material is a product attribute that will most influence pricing of athleticwear, as the actual cost of the material that is used to make the product is a logical factor in its pricing."

    "- **Product Name / Brand**: Identifies the item and confirms it belongs to Adidas.\n",
    "- **Garment Subtype**: Describes the product type (e.g., *T-shirt*, *Shorts*, *Leggings*, *Jacket*). Useful for comparing price differences between categories.\n",
    "- **Material Composition**: Describes the fabric makeup (e.g., *60% cotton, 40% polyester*). Synthetic materials like polyester are durable and cheaper, while natural fibers like organic cotton can increase price due to sustainability value.\n",
    "- **Color**: The primary color of the garment (categorical). Limited-edition colors or trendy shades may be priced higher.\n",
    "- **Gender**: The target audience—*Men*, *Women*, or *Unisex*. Allows testing for gender-based pricing (“Pink Tax”).\n",
    "- **Country of Production**: Where the item was manufactured (e.g., *Vietnam, China, Indonesia*). May affect cost because of labor and production expenses.\n",
    "- **Customer Rating**: Average rating (1–5 stars) reflecting consumer satisfaction. A higher rating may suggest higher perceived value or quality.\n",
    "- **Number of Reviews**: Total customer reviews, a proxy for product popularity or sales volume.\n",
    "- **Sale Price (USD)**: The main outcome variable, representing listed retail price in U.S. dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Data Concerns and Biases\n",
    "- **Online Marketplace Bias**: The dataset is sourced from online listings, which may not represent in-store pricing or promotional discounts.\n",
    "- **Self-Selection Bias**: Popular products with more reviews are overrepresented, while new or niche products might lack visibility.\n",
    "- **Missing or Inconsistent Entries**: Some records may have missing *country*, *rating*, or *review count* fields, especially for newly listed products.\n",
    "- **Duplicate Products**: Variants of the same item (e.g., same shirt in multiple colors) may appear multiple times and need consolidation.\n",
    "- **Temporal Variation**: Prices may change over time due to promotions, seasonal trends, or clearance sales.\n",

To limit any bias, we will clearly mention that the results from this project describe pricing strategies specific to Adidas pricing structure only and not the entire athleticwear industry to avoid overstating our conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> There is no personal information that is being collected in our data collection, and no privacy risks are present. All of the data is related to the products, not the individuals themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> We will check for unbalanced groups, especially with gender-specific items and the pricing associated with those products, to ensure that our model doesn't unintentionally reinforce bias or social stereotypes through Adidas’s marketing/pricing decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> No sensitive information is being stored. The datasets are from Kaggle and downloaded to a secure environment. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "> Not applicable to our project since the datasets were publicly shared by Kaggle and no personal information is stored or shared in the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> The data will be archived and/or deleted after our team finalizes analyzing and producing results - when the project concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> Our dataset only includes Adidas products, which lacks perspectives and inputs from other both larger and smaller athleticwear companies.We will make sure that we clearly state that our analysis only focuses on Adidas, and doesn't represent the dynamics of the broader athleticwear industry. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> We will make sure that we check for any imbalanced classes/representation in certain product features (material, color, category, origin, gender-target) within our data before moving into the modeling process. If we find any uneven representation, we will make sure to be transparent about it in our results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> We will clearly and honestly state our data cleaning, analysis and modeling process steps and make sure that our visualizations and reports accurately reflect our findings. Our team will also be explicit in stating that the correlations we find are descriptive of Adidas’s dataset(s) and not causal.  \n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> No PII exists in our data, so there are no privacy risks or concerns regarding this.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> All steps of analysis and modeling will be well documented in a Jupyter Notebook and in the GitHub repository to allow any replication in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> Since the dataset does include a gender-target variable, we will analyze to see if gendered products have consistent pricing patterns. We will check any gender-specific products to avoid reinforcing any stereotypes.This will ensure that our results do not unintentionally reproduce or justify disparities within pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> We will check for any variations in pricing when it comes to gender-specific products to make sure that our results are neutral and not biased in any kind of way. We will test whether pricing across different categories are statistically significant and if they reflect Adidas’s marketing decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We will use modeling techniques such as multiple linear regression to analyze the features in our data and loss functions such as MAE and/or MSE (Mean Absolute Error and/or Mean Squared Error) to optimize our defined metrics and for transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> Coefficients and features that are involved in regression and other visualizations will be used to show how each variable, such as material, color, category, origin, gender-target, influences the pricing of a product. This will ensure that our results are understandable for a general audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> We will communicate our findings very carefully to ensure that readers understand that our analysis applies only to Adidas’s dataset. This is because we are aware that misinterpreting our results as an attempt to generalize pricing across all brands could unintentionally reinforce misleading marketing assumptions. Our findings will be communicated to be specific to Adidas's marketing and pricing strategy, not pricing for products in the broader athleticwear industry. We will include clear disclaimers in our project to prevent any misunderstanding and communicate these limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> Not applicable because our team is not planning to deploy this model.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> Not applicable because individuals are not particularly affected by any outcomes of this model.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> Not applicable because our model is not under production.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> We will make sure to clarify that our model should not be used to justify variations in pricing within different product categories.\n",
    "While our model is not being deployed to the public, our findings in our model/project could be misused if taken out of context. For instance, someone could use our analysis from this project to justify the pricing differences for products by gender. To prevent any misuse and misinterpretation like this, we will explicitly state that our research does not justify, recommend, or endorse any discriminatory pricing strategies, especially for explicit commercial use. We will make a clear disclaimer which states that it is unethical to use our results/analysis for commercial use and pricing for products without proper equity testing, since it can perpetuate gender and/or economic inequalities. \n"
