    "What product attributes, such as material, color, category, country of origin, gender-target (gender product is marketed to), and popularity (measured by difference from mean number of ratings for garment type) most influence pricing in U.S. dollars of athleticwear in the U.S.?",

    "The prevalence of athletic wear, whether worn for leisure or actual activity, has been on the rise. In fact, the athletic wear market now represents a substantial and rapidly growing segment of the global apparel industry, with the North American market alone valued at over 26 billion dollars in 2024, and a projected value of 677.26 billion dollars by 2030. Among other things, this rapid growth can be attributed to a culture that is increasingly health-conscious, and the not-unrelated merging of fashion and functionality, dubbed "athlesiure". As casually-worn athletic wear becomes increasingly mainstream, however, there is the question of cost - specifically, what factors make it cost what is does?

Now, the question of what drives apparel pricing has been examined before. Multiple countries have used the hedonic model to calculate the Consumer Price Index, used to track inflation, for apparel in their countries. The hedonic model uses regression to "estimate a value for each characteristic of the item", which then all sum to the total price of the item. 1 The use of this technique allows researchers to make adjustments to account for seasonal changes and evolving product characteristics, essentially isolating the contribution of individual attributes to overall product pricing.

One factor, material composition, represents one of the most fundamental drivers of garment pricing, with significant research demonstrating its importance. In the active wear market, synthetic materials were very popular, supported by widespread use of polyester, which has moisture-wicking properties and is durable, important qualities for active wear to have.2However, consumer preferences are evolving with the times, and natural materials like organic cotton and bamboo blends are becoming more popular as eco-friendly and sustainable products, since sustainability has become a more mainstream concern. The price consumers are willing to pay for sustainable materials has been documented before. Research on outdoor apparel using hedonic pricing models found that material type had a statistically significant impact on item price, with different materials like cotton, polyester, wool, and nylon valued at different price points based on their breathability, durability, and environmental impact.3 Not to mention, raw material price fluctuations also significantly impact manufacturing costs for brands, with materials such as organic cotton subject to changes in supply and demand as well as energy and transportation costs. This cost pressure directly influences retail pricing strategies, as manufacturers must balance quality expectations with competitive pricing.

Another important consideration for pricing that transcends the realm of clothing is the "Pink Tax", or gender based pricing. This is a recorded phenomenon, even reported on by the U.S. Congress's Joint Economic Committee, which notes that "... the frequency with which female consumers find themselves paying higher prices for gender-specific goods and services effectively becomes a tax on being a woman".4 Gender-targeted marketing and its relationship to pricing represents one of the most controversial aspects of apparel pricing research, with another 2015 study by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs finding that women's clothing was 8% more expensive than men's clothing on average.5 Not only that, but women's clothing imports face higher average tariff rates than men's clothing, with women's clothing at 15.1% compared to 11.9% for men.6 However, other research challenges the notion of gender-based pricing. Studies like these find that most comparable products differed in their ingredient compositions, suggesting that price differences may reflect genuine product differentiation rather than discriminatory pricing. 7 The debate centers on distinguishing between legitimate reasons in pricing difference and discriminatory practices, something we wish to also explore on a smaller level, in our analysis of what determines the cost of athletic wear.

Country of Origin Effects Country of origin (COO) represents another well-established driver of consumer perceptions and pricing in apparel markets. The COO effect describes how consumers' attitudes, perceptions, and purchasing decisions are influenced by products' country of origin labeling, which may refer to where a brand is based, where products are designed, or where they are manufactured. Research has empirically demonstrated that the COO effect has significant price-related consequences, with brands possessing favorable COO associations able to charge price premiums over and above those attributed to observable product differentiation 8. The strength of COO effects varies considerably by product category and consumer characteristics. In apparel specifically, research examining clothing from multiple countries found that COO was related to assessment of product quality, but when evaluating purchase likelihood, COO seemed not to be as important, suggesting a more complex situation.9

The influence of popularity metrics on pricing is a newer area of research enabled by e-commerce platforms, which we choose to measure in the form of customer reviews and ratings in the absence of actual total purchasing data. Consumer surveys consistently shows that ratings and reviews are considered very important, with up to 98% of shoppers saying reviews are an "essential resource when making purchase decisions".10 Research also demonstrates that products with five reviews have 270% greater purchase likelihood than products with no reviews, but these benefits diminish rapidly after the first five reviews, according to Northwestern.11 Conjoint analysis research also indicates that "consumers considered star rating, number of reviews, online shopping platform, and premium reviews to be more important than price when making an online shopping decision". 12 However, there are many factors that differentiate from study to study, and so we would like to uncover ourselves how perceived popularity influence product pricing in the realm of active wear.

While individual attributes influencing apparel pricing have been studied on their own, comprehensive research examining the effects of material, color, category, origin, gender-targeting, and popularity metrics specifically within the athleticwear segment is still limited. As such, we plan to employ a comprehensive dataset of U.S. athleticwear products to try to quantify the relative importance of these diverse attributes in determining price, and hopefully providing insight into the factors that decide how much a product costs.

Athleticwear has become one of the biggest parts of the fashion industry, especially with the rise of fitness culture and athleisure clothing. Big brands like Adidas have built their image around performance and lifestyle wear, selling products that mix comfort, function, and style. Research on fashion pricing has shown that things like brand reputation, material quality, and product design have a big impact on how much items cost online. One study found that brands with stronger reputations tend to keep higher prices and are less likely to discount their items. https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isase/ISASE2019/0/ISASE2019_1_8/_article?utm_source

Another study on denim clothing showed that items made from unique or mixed materials often had higher prices because people see them as higher quality. https://www.mdpi.com/2673-7248/3/1/2?utm_source

For Adidas specifically, there’s been some research on its marketing and pricing strategies, but not much on what exact product attributes drive those prices. One paper mentioned that Adidas focuses heavily on innovation and sustainability while still trying to improve how it prices and markets its products. https://www.ewadirect.com/proceedings/aemps/article/view/3640?utm_source

Another study found that brand image, product quality, and marketing are major factors influencing how customers view Adidas and what they’re willing to pay. https://bsq.cultechpub.com/index.php/bsq/article/view/2?utm_source Even though these studies show that branding and quality matter, they don’t really dig into which features like material, color, or product category make certain Adidas items cost more than others. Our project aims to explore that gap by analyzing online pricing data for Adidas products in the U.S. to see which product details have the biggest impact on price."
